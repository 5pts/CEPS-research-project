\section{Introduction}
In the context of China’s educational stratification, the Hukou (household registration) system remains a persistent institutional barrier, creating a dual structure that disadvantages rural-to-urban migrant children. While compulsory education policies have expanded access, significant disparities persist in educational expectations—a key psychological precursor to attainment—between migrant and local students \parencite{wu2010economic, xie2014income}. Unlike academic achievement, which reflects past performance, educational expectations capture students’ perceived future possibilities and are highly sensitive to their social environment. Understanding the drivers of these expectations is essential, particularly for migrant adolescents who must navigate a system that often limits their access to urban high schools.

To explain variations in educational expectations, scholars widely utilize Social Capital Theory. However, a nuanced understanding requires distinguishing between the types of social ties. Drawing on Stanton-Salazar's \parencite{stanton2011social} framework of institutional agents, this study operationalizes social capital into two distinct forms: bonding social capital and bridging social capital. Here, bonding refers to horizontal ties among peers, which provide emotional solidarity. In contrast, bridging is defined as vertical ties with teachers—institutional agents who possess dominant cultural capital and information necessary to navigate the educational hierarchy. While peer cliques (bonding) may sometimes reinforce anti-school subcultures, teacher-student interactions (bridging) serve as vital conduits for resources that are otherwise inaccessible to disadvantaged families.

Despite the extensive use of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) in recent literature, few studies have empirically tested the heterogeneous effects of these two forms of social capital. Most existing research aggregates social capital into a single construct or focuses primarily on family SES \parencite{sun2020family}, failing to disentangle whether peer bonding and teacher bridging function differently for distinct student groups. This gap is significant: for migrant students lacking local roots, does strong bonding with other migrants lead to social segmentation from the mainstream, while bridging with teachers acts as a necessary compensatory mechanism? The interaction between social capital types and institutional status remains under-explored. This study addresses these issues by utilizing national baseline data from the CEPS. We structurally distinguish between bonding (peer) and bridging (teacher) social capital to examine their distinct impacts on educational expectations. Crucially, we incorporate Hukou status as a key moderator, investigating whether the marginal return of bridging social capital is greater for migrant students compared to their local counterparts, while strictly controlling for family SES to isolate the institutional effect. By doing so, this paper seeks to reveal how specific relational resources can either mitigate or exacerbate the structural inequalities imposed by the Hukou system.

\section{Literature Review}
