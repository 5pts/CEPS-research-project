2 Research Questions and Hypotheses
- H1 (Main Effect): Teacher Linking and Peer Bonding positively predict educational expectations (controlling SES, hukou, cognition).
- H2 (Compensatory Effect):
  - H2a: Linking benefits low-SES students more than high-SES students (Linking × SES < 0).
  - H2b: Bonding benefits low-SES students more than high-SES students (Bonding × SES < 0).
  - H2c: Linking benefits rural hukou students more than urban hukou students (Linking × Rural > 0).
- H3 (Exploratory): Compare the magnitude of compensatory effects—Which is stronger, Bonding or Linking?

2 Literature Review
Prior research on social capital is discussed in Coleman (1988). Related work is also reviewed by Liu (2015).

3 Data and Methods
3.1 Data Source
This study uses CEPS Wave 2 data. Analytical sample ≈ 9,314 students after excluding responses coded 10 = “无所谓” (non-ordinal). Class IDs (clsids) are used for clustered SE.

3.2 Statistical Model
- Outcome: expect_edu_raw ∈ {1,…,9} (10 = “无所谓” excluded).
- Predictors:
  - Bonding index (peer climate): mean of w2b0605/0606/0607, z-scored.
  - Linking index (teacher–student): teacher_praise = mean(w2b0507/0508/0509); teacher_talk = w2c09 (1→1, 2/3→0); each z, summed, re-z.
  - SES (PCA composite): parent education, family econ, books, desk, computer (inverted), first PC, z-scored.
  - Hukou (0 urban, 1 rural), cognitive score (0 treated as missing, rest z).
- Model: Ordered logit \(P(Y \le k|x)=\Lambda(\theta_k - x'\beta)\), k=1..8; clustered SE by clsids.
- PO check: LR test vs multinomial logit (PO rejected; ordered logit kept for interpretability; multinomial/partial PO as robustness).
- Interactions: Bonding×SES, Linking×SES, Linking×Rural.

4 Results
- Main effects (template): Linking ≈ 0.22 (p<0.001), Bonding ≈ 0.14 (p<0.001), SES ≈ 0.33, Hukou ≈ 0.11 (p≈0.02), Cognitive ≈ 0.56 (p<0.001).
- Interactions: Bonding×SES positive (MLE p≈0.015; clustered p≈0.052 trend), Linking×SES ns, Linking×Rural positive but ns (p≈0.16).
- Nonlinearity: Spline suggests Linking may be nonlinear (p≈0.005); Bonding shows no nonlinearity.
- Selection: 10 = “无所谓” group differs on SES/cog/bonding/linking/hukou; external validity limited to 1–9.

5 Discussion
Discuss whether evidence supports compensatory vs advantage accumulation: Bonding shows advantage accumulation; Linking is neutral/weakly compensatory for rural; PO violation caveat; nonlinearity caveat; cross-sectional causality limits; perceived (not network) measures.
