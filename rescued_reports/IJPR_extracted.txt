Using nation-wide survey data (N=2328) from China, this study
investigates how social support from family, peers, and teachers inﬂuence
low-income household children’s (from 13 to 15 years old) academic
resilience, as well as how academic resilience mediates the relationship
between social support and children’s academic achievement. Structural
equation modelling was adopted to analyse the data. The results reveal
that (1) low-income household children’s family, peer, and teacher
support are associated with their academic resilience; (2) peer support
and academic resilience of low-income household children signiﬁcantly
relate with their academic achievements; (3) academic resilience plays
a full mediation role in teacher support and a partial mediation role in
peer support on children’s academic achievement. The implications of
this study on theory and practice, the limitations, and future research
directions are discussed.
Resumen.
Utilizando datos de encuestas a nivel nacional (N = 2328) de China, este
estudio investiga cómo el apoyo social de la familia, los compañeros y
los maestros inﬂuyen en la resiliencia académica de los niños de bajos
ingresos (de 13 a 15 años), así como la resiliencia académica interviene en
la relación entre el apoyo social y el rendimiento académico de los niños.
Se adoptó el modelo de ecuaciones estructurales para analizar los datos.
Los resultados revelan que (1) el apoyo familiar, de pares y de maestros de
niños de bajos ingresos en el hogar está asociado con su capacidad de
resilencia académica; (2) el apoyo entre pares y la resilencia académica de
los niños de hogares de bajos ingresos se relacionan signiﬁcativamente
con sus logros académicos; (3) la capacidad de resilencia académica
desempeña un papel de mediación total en el apoyo del maestro y un papel
de mediación parcial en el apoyo de los compañeros en el rendimiento
académico de los niños. Se discuten las implicaciones de este estudio en la
teoría y la práctica, además de las limitaciones y las futuras direcciones de
investigación.

Low-Income Children and Academic Resilience
1. Introduction
According to the survey of National Bureau of Statis-
tics of China (NBSC), as to 2017, there were millions
of children living in poverty in mainland China (NBSC,
2018). In addition, many studies reported that fam-
ily’s social economic status (SES) has signiﬁcant impacts
on children academic performance. For example, two
meta-analysis studies proved that a family’s SES posi-
tively inﬂuences academic outcomes of children (Sirin,
2005; White, 1982). This may infer that compared with
children who are not at risk, children in economically
disadvantaged households may have a lower academic
performance. In the Chinese public education system,
the junior middle school (Grade 7 to Grade 9) is a transit
period between primary school and high middle school.
Grade 7 and Grade 9 are therefore extremely important,
because in these two grades, students need to learn the
adaptation to the new period of learning. Thus, under-
standing how to improve the academic performance of
children in low-income households in Grades 7 and 9 is
critically signiﬁcant.
Resilience oﬀers us a new perspective to understand
this problem, because it relates to risk and protective
factors(Luthar, 1991), such as an individual’s traumatic
experiences, challenges, and ability to cope with diﬃ-
culties(Masten, 2001). The present study adopts the
social-ecological framework of academic resilience, inves-
tigating how social support inﬂuences academic achieve-
ment, including test scores in mathematics, science, and
language and whether or not the academic resilience
mediated this eﬀect.
Recently, the concept of resilience was deﬁned in a
holistic approach by introducing the ecological theory of
human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Based on
the social-ecological theory, resilience was deﬁned as the
way individuals gain the capacity to cope with internal
and external resources and risks (Ungar, Ghazinour, &
Richter, 2013). Similarly, academic resilience refers to “a
capacity to overcome acute or chronic adversity that is
seen as a major threat to a student’s educational devel-
opment” (Martin, 2013, p. 488). In this study, we adopt
the deﬁnition of Martin (2013) and extend its meaning
by adding the resilience in a school context. Masten
and Coatsworth (1998) suggested that context may in-
ﬂuence resilience development, and this point is further
explained by Theron (2008), as the context includes in-
dividuals, families, and environmental capacities. In line
with resilience, academic resilience may also be inﬂu-
enced by factors from individuals, families, peers, and
schools (Garmezy, 1991).
Peer support in school plays an essential role when
children face adverse circumstances (Werner & Ruth,
1982). Felsman (1989) found the positive eﬀect of peer
support on students’ resilience and this eﬀect existed
regardless of students’ age, gender, and their family SES(Stewart & Sun, 2004). In China, six important functions
of peers were identiﬁed among high school students (age
16-18 year old), including caring and support in everyday
life, academic expectations and involvement, spiritual
encouragement, behavioural discipline, and guidance,
providing opportunities for meaningful involvement and
role modelling (H. Li, Bottrell, & Armstrong, 2017). In
contrast, an Indian study found that when young men
experienced a high level of peer bullying, this leads to
a low level of resilience (Narayanan & Betts, 2014). To
summarise, a high level of peer support may lead to
a high level of academic resilience (Robinson, Raine,
Robertson, Steen, & Day, 2015).
The research also notes that teacher support is a vital
factor of academic resilience development (Werner, 1990).
Theron (2016) indicated four key processes of teachers
facilitating students’ resilience: 1) building warm, re-
spectful relationships with students; 2) communicating
achievable and consistent expectations of students; 3)
regarding students as active and capable agents; 4) de-
veloping resilience-supporting classroom practice and
environments. By interviewing students, teachers ac-
tively participate in regular ‘little things’ in classroom,
such as listening to students’ views or making themselves
accessibleto students, which couldalso promote students’
resilience (Johnson, 2008).
However, when primary students suﬀered teachers’
verbalabuse, theyweremorelikelytohavenegativelearn-
ing experiences toward teachers and react in covert ways,
suchaskeepingsilentorwithdrawingfromschool (Geiger,
2017). Similarly, if students have a negative sense of
school safety and low engagement in the classroom, they
are more likely to have lower resilience (Sanders, Mun-
ford, & Liebenberg, 2016; Sanders, Munford, Thimasarn-
Anwar, Liebenberg, & Ungar, 2015). Students who were
bullied by teachers or other school staﬀ were more likely
to report low school engagement and negative experi-
ences toward school climate (Datta, Cornell, & Huang,
2017). Thus, teacher support inﬂuences positively stu-
dents’ academic resilience in schools.
Family support is another vital factor in proving
child’s academic resilience. By interviewing 26 children
and their parents, Taket, Nolan, and Stagnitti (2014)
ﬁgured out four strategies parents used to develop chil-
dren’s resilience capacity, including cultivating children’s
independence ability, promoting children’s competence
in socio-emotional learning, building supportive relation-
ships with adults, and using community resources. H. Li
(2017)suggestedthatstudentswhoobtainedmoreparental
supervisioninthefamilyandmoreactiveengagementin
school could change their situations of low school com-
mitmentandtheirpersonalconﬂictattitude, improving
theiracademicachievements. Incontrast, young people
who lack eﬀective parental monitoring and support have
lower resilience (Sanders et al., 2016, 2015).

Low-Income Children and Academic Resilience
Academic resilience was found to positively corre-
late with female students’ academic outcomes (Allan,
McKenna, & Dominey, 2014). This ﬁnding is echoed by
Ayala and Manzano (2018), as the impacts of resilience
on academic performance varies on students’ gender and
their learning motivations. By conducting longitudinal
research, Sattler and Gershoﬀ (2019) compared the dif-
ferences in the impact of three levels of resilience on
mathematics and literacy achievement among children
from kindergarten to the 5thgrade in primary school.
Compared with high-resilient children, non-resilience and
low-resilience children have signiﬁcantly lower mathemat-
ical and literacy achievement (Sattler & Gershoﬀ, 2019).
Among Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents, self-
resilience signiﬁcantly predicted youths’ positive aca-
demic emotions (D. Wang, Hu, & Yin, 2017). Based
on protection theory of resilience, H. Li (2017) found
students’ academic resilience positively predicted their
academic performance. These ﬁndings suggest that chil-
dren’s academic resilience may improve their academic
outcomes.
Peer support, family support and teacher support
also play important roles in improving students’ aca-
demic outcomes. Exemplifying the former, by using a
longitudinal social network design, one study found that
positive peer inﬂuence could improve students’ writing
and mathematics performance (DeLay et al., 2016). In
a very recent study, peers were found having a posi-
tive impact on their friends’ school engagement, such
as emotional, behavioural, and cognitive engagement in
the classroom (Liu et al., 2018; M. Wang, Kiuru, Degol,
& Salmela-Aro, 2018). In contrast, peer victimization
and peer depression were negatively correlated with chil-
dren’s academic achievement (Liu et al., 2018). In early
childhood research, parental rearing beliefs and parental
practices could act as precursors to and have a posi-
tive impact on the academic outcomes of children from
families living in poverty (Liew, Carlo, Streit, & Ispa,
2018). While both parent support and peer support have
a signiﬁcant positive eﬀect on academic self-eﬃcacy of
children who are from a low-income family, the eﬀect of
parent support, especially parental emotional support, is
larger than the eﬀect of peer support (Ramirez, Machida,
Kline,&Huang, 2014). However, parentalengagementin
schools has no signiﬁcant impact on students’ academic
outcomes (Ramirez et al., 2014). Further, researchers
found peer support, which measured as peer threat, has
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on school performance of students
who live in a low-income family, whereas teacher sup-
port has a medium eﬀect on their academic achievement
(Elias & Haynes, 2008).
From the above review, we ﬁnd some research gaps
that exist in the current research. Firstly, most research
focus on the inﬂuential factors of academic resilience
and ignore its mediation eﬀect between social support
and students’ academic performance. Secondly, previ-ous studies were conducted in Western contexts, and
research seldom focused on the Chinese economically dis-
advantaged household children. Thus, this study could
contribute in two ways, by: 1) analysing the impacts
of multidimensional social support on the academic re-
silience of children in low-income household; 2) assessing
the academic resilience mediation eﬀect between social
support and academic outcomes of Chinese low-income
household children.
To clearly describe the whole framework, the follow-
ing research hypotheses are proposed:
H1a: Family support may directly impact academic
achievement of economically disadvantaged children.
H1b: Family support may directly impact academic
resilience of economically disadvantaged children.
H1c: Academic resilience mediates the relationship
of family support and academic achievement.
H2a: Peer support may directly impact academic
achievement of economically disadvantaged children.
H2b: Peer support may directly impact academic
resilience of economically disadvantaged children.
H2c: Academic resilience mediates the relationship
of peer support and academic achievement.
H3a: Teacher support may directly impact academic
achievement of economically disadvantaged children.
H3b: Teacher support may directly impact academic
resilience of economically disadvantaged children.
H3c: Academic resilience mediates the relationship
of teacher support and academic achievement.
H4: Resilience may directly impact the academic
achievement of economically disadvantaged children.
2. Method
2.1 Data Resource: China Education Panel Survey
The present study adopted the data of Chinese Educa-
tion Panel Survey (CEPS) (2013-2014), accessing from
(https://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/), which focuses on Chinese sec-
ondary school students who are in grade 7 and grade
9 (year 13-15), including 1216 male (52.2%), 1068 fe-
male (45.9%), while 44 students did not provide their
gender information. This survey aims at obtaining rela-
tively comprehensive information on Chinese secondary
education from multiple perspectives, such as students,
parents, homeroom teachers, subject teachers, and school
administrators. The CEPS uses a stratiﬁed, multi-stage
sampling technique wherein 28 districts from a popula-
tion of 2870 districts were chosen. From each of these 28
districts, four schools were selected, and four classes of
grade 7 and grade 9 were randomly selected from each
school. As a result, approximately 20,000 students in
448 classrooms of 112 schools were selected in the CEPS.
This study adopts data from the student perspective.
Based on the question of ‘What is your family’s current
economic situation?’ Economically disadvantaged stu-

Low-Income Children and Academic Resilience
dents (N=2328) were conﬁrmed as those who answered:
“very poor” or “poor”. This study is conducted based on
these students’ information.
2.2 Key Measures and Variable Deﬁnitions
Academic achievements: all students need to report their
most recent test scores for mid-term exams in Chinese,
English, and mathematics. Originally a 150-point score
in total, each students’ raw score is changed into a stan-
dard score with standard deviation=70 and mean=10.
The sampling students’ standardized scores in three sub-
jects are the dependent variable of this study.
Metheny, McWhirter, and O’Neil (2008) reviewed
the existed 17 tools on measuring teacher support on
students’ perspective and proposed a four-dimensional
structure of teacher support, which included teachers’
investment in students’ learning, teachers’ emotional sup-
port, teachers’ expectations, and teachers’ accessibility
of students. In CEPS (2013-2014), teacher support was
assessed on two aspects: how often teachers ask ques-
tions on subject content and how often teachers praise
students. Based on Chinese teaching culture, teachers
asking questions is regarded as one of the strategies
teachers concerning students’ learning use and could be
regarded as teachers’ investment in students’ learning.
Thus, teacher support was assessed on two aspects: in-
vestment and emotions. In addition, considering the
diﬀerences of subjects, teacher support was measured
using six items. Students are required to rate both des-
criptions on a 4- Likert scale ranging from 1=strongly
disagree to 4=strongly agree.
According to Pitzer and Skinner (2017), peer sup-
port was regarded as the component of supportive class-
room interactions among peers, including warm relations,
structural classroom context and supporting autonomy.
Consistent with this deﬁnition, in the CEPS (2013-2014),
peer support was examined on two aspects: warm rela-
tions and structural classroom context using two items.
It was measured on a 4-Likert scale ranging from 1=
strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree.
AccordingtoZimet,Dahlem, Zimet,andFarley(1988)
as well as (Chou, 2000), family support mainly focuses on
the supporting willingness, emotional support, decision-
making support, and the availability of discussing prob-
lems that children are facing on. In a line with this
content, family support in CEPS (2013-2014) also covers
two aspects: emotional support form parent and their
availability of discussing problems that children have in
schools. Speciﬁcally, family support was measured using
four items. Students’ responses to the questions were
scaled on a 3-Likert format (1=never, 2=sometimes, and
3=always).
According to Martin and Marsh (2006) and Martin
(2013), academic resilience mainly concerns on how stu-
dents cope with the adversity or diﬃculties within aca-
demic settings. Then, the measurement of academicresilience focuses on students’ responses to their emo-
tional issues during learning, academic pressures, or
some other setbacks within schools (Martin & Marsh,
2006). Consistent with this method, academic resilience
in CEPS (2013-2014) concerned on how students tackle
with the negative emotional response and academic pres-
sures. Academic resilience was measured on three as-
pects, including students’ negative feelings toward school
engagement, emotional issue, and academic pressure
using three items. All these items were examined on
4-Likert scales (1=strongly disagree, 4=strongly agree).
2.3 Data Analysis
The normality of these four constructs is tested. Based
on the suggestion of Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and
Tatham (2010), a skewness-kurtosis test is conducted
to assess whether the data follows the rule of normal
distribution. The values of skewness and kurtosis range
from-1.133to.496, andfrom-1.446to2.186, respectively,
which follow the rule of (Kline, 2010) that the values be
within the ranges of |3| and |8|.
In this study, it was used the Partial Least Squares
Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), which is a
non-parametric test and is adopted to analyse the data
by using SmartPLS3.0 (Ringle, Wende, & Becker, 2015)
with several considerations. First, PLS-SEM is a compli-
cated model that includes multiple independent variables
and mediated variables, and has been shown to be ca-
pable of assessing parameters of complex models (Hair,
Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2017). It allows enormous
ﬂexibility on the number of items of the construct and
the measurement scales. Second, because the majority of
constructs in this study were assessed by diﬀerent scale
criteria, there might be measure errors or systematic
errors. This requires rigorous computation of param-
eters which the PLS-SEM meets (Chin, 2010). Last,
academic resilience is always treated as an entity rather
than divided into diﬀerent components. Thus, in this
study we are trying to explore the theory rather than
conﬁrm it. As such, the PLS-SEM is regarded as the
most suitable data analysis technique for our study.
More speciﬁcally, two-steps analysing procedures are
conducted to examine model hypotheses. First, we use
the PLS algorithm technique for testing the outer model
and its reliability and validity. Then, the bootstrapping
technique is conducted to conﬁrm the structural model
relationships as well as compute the eﬀect size of each
path by using the blindfolding technique (Hair, Sarstedt,
Hopkins, & Kuppelwieser, 2014).

As outlined in Table 1, only the factor loading of
item ’a1201’ is below .7, so it seems this item needs to
be deleted (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). However,
all constructs’ value of AVE is over .5 and all constructs’
value of CR is over .7, thus, in this study, we keep this
item in the resilience. As to Cronbach’s alpha, its value
ranges from nearly .6 to .886, and four constructs’ alpha
values are below .7 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). How-
ever, we cannot conclude that we get a weak reliability
of these constructs because (1) the Cronbach’s alpha is
too sensitive to the number of items in each construct
and (2) the CR estimated the combined reliability of all
items to the latent variables and its values (all over .7)
show good reliability of each construct.
If the square roots of the AVE of each construct is
over the correlation coeﬃcients of two constructs, then
we can conﬁrm the construct has good discriminant
validity(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). As shown in Table
2, all constructs’ discriminant validity meet this rule,
which reveals a reasonable discriminant validity for the
constructs.It is proposed that the standardized root means
square residuals (SRMR) and NFI are two indicators of
the model ﬁt to assess to what extent the data ﬁts the
model in SmartPLS3.0 (Henseler, Hubona, & Ray, 2016).Table 2

In this study, the SRMR=.064 is less than 0.1 (Hu &
Bentler, 1995a) and NFI=.705 is less than the suggested
.8(Hu & Bentler, 1995b). Thus, basically, this is a ﬁtted
model.
3.2 Structural Model Assessment
Using the bootstrapping technique with 1000 re-
samples, the path coeﬃcients in this model are estimated,
as shown in Table 3. Besides the hypothesis of H1aand
H3a, all the other hypothesis paths are signiﬁcantly sup-
ported. Students’ perception of academic resilience is
signiﬁcantly impacted by teacher support ( β=.16), peer
support (β=.131), and family support ( β=.083). The
result also reveals that students’ academic achievements
are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by peer support ( β=.102) and
academic resilience ( β=.123).

To test the mediation eﬀect of academic resilience, we
adopt Chin (2010)’s two-steps bootstrapping procedures.
The eﬀects, ﬁrstly, between family support, peer support,
and teacher support and academic achievement without
the mediator variable are assessed (see the section of
Direct eﬀects without mediator in Table 4). The results
indicate that academic achievement has a signiﬁcant re-
lationship between peer support ( β=.119) and teacher
support(β=.065). However, therelationshipbetweenfa-

Then, we add academic resilience as the mediator
variable and the three coeﬃcients of family support, peer
support, teacher support, and academic achievement
are declined. As shown in Table 3 and Table 4, the
relationship between peer support and academic achieve-
ment is still signiﬁcant, declined from .119 to .102, but
the relationship between teacher support and academic
achievement changes into insigniﬁcant, the coeﬃcient de-
clined from .065 to .029. Meanwhile, all indirect eﬀects
between family support, peer support, teacher support,
and academic achievement are supported. Thus, we
conclude that academic resilience has a partial medi-
ated eﬀect between peer support, family support and
academic achievement and has a full mediated eﬀect
between teacher support and academic achievement.

4. Discussions
4.1 The Direct and Indirect Eﬀects of Peer Support
This study reveals that peer support has a positive eﬀect
on low-income household children’s academic resilience.
This ﬁnding is consistent with some existing research
conducted in the western context that, when students get
strong support from their friends, they are more likely
to have a high level of academic resilience (Robinson et
al., 2015; Stewart & Sun, 2004). However, the ﬁnding
is inconsistent with an investigation in China by C. Li,
Zhang, and Li (2008) who found no signiﬁcant eﬀect
between peer social capital and resilience. One possible
reason is the diﬀerence in deﬁning the construct of peer
support. In our study, we assess two aspects of peer
support –friendly to individuals and good for learning–
while, in Li et al.’s research, they measured peer capital
on both positively and negatively aspects.
Peer support also shows a positive impact on stu-
dents’ academic outcome, in agreement with the study
of Ramirez et al. (2014) but against the ﬁnding of EliasTable 4

and Haynes (2008). This disagreement may be because
(Elias & Haynes, 2008) measured peer support by focus-
ing on peer threat. They used items with a negative
tone, for instance, “do you get picked on and teased by
your friends?” or “do you feel left out by your friends?”
(p. 480).
By regarding academic resilience as a mediator, the
impact of peer support to low-income household chil-
dren’s academic achievement remains signiﬁcant, which
means academic resilience, has a partial mediation ef-
fect on this relationship. Thus, we may conclude that
peer support has a positive eﬀect on children’s academic
achievement, partially through increasing children’s aca-
demic resilience. This ﬁnding could contribute to the
development of the theory of how peer support improves
children’s academic outcomes by raising their academic
resilience.
4.2 TheDirectandIndirectEﬀectsofFamilySupport
This study echoes the prevalent conclusion that family
support has a positive eﬀect on children’s academic re-
silience, irrespective of their family’s economic status
(C. Li, Zhang, & Li, 2018; Sanders et al., 2015). However,
it is interesting that family support has no signiﬁcant
impact on academic outcome of those from a low-income
family and this result is inconsistent with some other
studies(Liew et al., 2018; Ramirez et al., 2014). There
are two possible reasons for this. First, according to the
code theory (Bernstein, 1962), low-income families are
more likely to use restricted code to express some simple
opinions and the understanding of their speech relies on
their speciﬁc context, while the middle and upper-class

Low-Income Children and Academic Resilience
families always use the elaborated code, which includes
complete and relatively complicated meanings. The elab-
orated code is more powerful than a restricted code in
expressing someone’s thoughts and does not depend on
the speciﬁc context. In the school context, teachers pre-
fertousetheelaboratedcodetotransferknowledge, thus,
the working-class or low-income family’s children cannot
engage in school education as eﬀectively as those from
the middle or upper-class family. Second, the Chinese
culture may inﬂuence parents’ emotional engagement
in children’s learning. For instance, an experimental re-
search revealed that, compared with the USA parent, the
Chinese parent shows a low level of emotional intensity
and low emotional experience (Davis et al., 2012). This
means the Chinese parent is not good at expressing their
emotions in their daily life. This eﬀect may inﬂuence
family support having no signiﬁcant impact on children’s
academic achievement in the Chinese context.
4.3 The Direct and Indirect Eﬀects of Teacher
Support
Our study is consistent with the existing ﬁndings that
teacher support could improve students’ academic re-
silience(Johnson, 2008; Werner, 1990). Furthermore,
thisstudyconﬁrmedthat, ifchildrenfromthelow-income
family gain more praise from their teachers, they are
more likely to have a high capacity for coping with
adverse conditions (Sanders et al., 2016). It is interest-
ing to note that academic resilience fully mediated the
eﬀect of teacher support on children’s academic achieve-
ment. This means before adding the academic resilience,
teacher support signiﬁcantly impact children’s academic
outcomes; however, this eﬀect changes to insigniﬁcant af-
ter we added the teacher support as the mediator. Based
on this ﬁnding, we suggest teacher support may have
a positive impact on low-income children’s academic
achievement but through inﬂuencing the children’s aca-
demic resilience.
4.4 Academic Resilience and Low-income Children’s
Academic Achievement
This study’s ﬁndings are consistent with many current
ﬁndings that academic resilience has a positive eﬀect
on children’s academic achievement, regardless of family
economicstatus (Sattler&Gershoﬀ, 2019; D.Wangetal.,
2017). In addition, though, there are two new ﬁndings:
academic resilience partially mediated the eﬀect of peer
support and fully mediated the eﬀect of teacher support.
In another recent study, academic resilience mediated
the eﬀects of social support on educational aspiration
and plan to drop out, and of family support on academic
eﬀort and plan to drop out (Wu, Tsang, & Ming, 2014).
Our study complements these ﬁndings in two aspects: 1)
we measure academic achievement directly using English,
Chinese, and mathematics testing scores; 2) we prove
the eﬀects of peer support and teacher support.4.5 Implications of the Present Study
Several implications can be proposed for theory and prac-
tice improvement. By adopting an ecological framework
of academic resilience that encompasses peer, teacher,
and family support, this study deepens our understand-
ing of to what extent and by which path these social
supports improve academic achievement by extending to
children from low-income household in China.
Practically, to improve low-income household chil-
dren’s school performance, the following two suggestions
should be considered carefully: 1) pay more attention
to family, such as parents oﬀering more diverse support
and learn how to express emotions to their children; 2)
provide suggestions to children on how to make friends
and how to keep healthy friendships, in recognition that
peers are vital for improving both academic resilience
and outcomes.
4.6 Limitations and Future Research
There are at least two limitations in this research. First,
because it is based on the secondary data, this study
is data-driven rather than theory-driven, thus some vi-
tal information of participants cannot be obtained. In
addition, this is a cross-sectional design, it can only be
used to conclude correlational results and cannot ob-
tain causality eﬀects between variables. Finally, the
low-income household children were ﬁgured out by their
own response, while teenagers may have bias perceptions
toward their family’s economic conditions. Therefore, it
may have measurement errors in classifying the family
in poverty.
In future, more studies should focus on casual eﬀect
of academic resilience on both its sources and impacts by
using longitudinal study or experimental study. Mean-
while, future studies could focus on comparative research
on minorities and majorities, local and international.
5. Conclusion
The present study reports the impact of students’ per-
ceived teacher, peer, and family support on their aca-
demic performance as well as examines the mediation ef-
fectofacademicresiliencebetweenthesesupportandaca-
demic outcomes using PLS-SEM and the bootstrapping
technique. This study found that academic resilience
of children from low-income family is signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
enced by peer, family, and teacher support, while their
academic achievements are only signiﬁcant inﬂuenced
by peer support and academic resilience. Speciﬁcally,
academic resilience has partial mediation eﬀect between
peer support and academic achievement, and full me-
diation eﬀect between teacher support and academic
achievement.
