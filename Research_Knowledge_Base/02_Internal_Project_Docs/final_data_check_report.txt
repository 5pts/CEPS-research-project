teacher_praise: 11 missing
teacher_talk: 170 missing
cog_score: 0 missing

--- 5. Linkage Columns ---
[PASS] Linkage key 'clsids' is present.
[PASS] Linkage key 'schids' is present.

--- 6. Missingness Health Check ---
teacher_praise (missing rate 0.11%)
  - ses_self: mean diff 330.989 (missing mean 1137.065, non-missing mean 806.076)
  - schids: mean diff 14.079 (missing mean 73.727, non-missing mean 59.648)
  - cog_score: mean diff -4.775 (missing mean 18.091, non-missing mean 22.866)
teacher_talk (missing rate 1.73%)
  - ses_self: mean diff -240.841 (missing mean 569.772, non-missing mean 810.613)
  - schids: mean diff 9.399 (missing mean 68.900, non-missing mean 59.501)
  - cog_score: mean diff -4.031 (missing mean 18.900, non-missing mean 22.931)
Heuristic flags (potentially non-random missingness):
- teacher_praise vs ses_self: mean gap 330.989
- teacher_praise vs schids: mean gap 14.079
- teacher_praise vs cog_score: mean gap -4.775
- teacher_talk vs cog_score: mean gap -4.031

--- 6b. Missingness Impact Summary ---
[PASS] Overall missingness across key predictors is low (1.84%). Impact on conclusions is likely limited.
