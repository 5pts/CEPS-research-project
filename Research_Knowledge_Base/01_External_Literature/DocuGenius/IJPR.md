Abstract.
Using nation-wide survey data (N=2328) from China, this study
investigates how social support from family, peers, and teachers influence
low-income household children’s (from 13 to 15 years old) academic
resilience, as well as how academic resilience mediates the relationship
between social support and children’s academic achievement. Structural
equation modelling was adopted to analyse the data. The results reveal
that (1) low-income household children’s family, peer, and teacher
support are associated with their academic resilience; (2) peer support
